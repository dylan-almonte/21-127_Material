## Homeworks

Concepts is one of the first classes at CMU where you realize getting the right answer
doesn't mean you get 100%...with proofs, even if you feel like you "get it," properly
communicating that you understand how to prove the problem can be much more difficult.
Proofs will feel unnecessary harshly graded at first, but the purpose of the course is to 
teach you how to be rigorous in your proofs. Every time you lose points on a proof, try 
to understand why your explanation is flawed. A good way to start to write proofs is to 
mimic what you do in class. Lectures provide all the knowledge necessary to do well
on homework assignments so consistent attendance is important.

## Exams

Concepts exams contain questions that are easier versions of the HW, but might be content that
you haven't necessarily seen before, so you can't just regurgitate proofs from the HW.
The difficulty for exams usually comes from that they have to be completed in short time periods,
usually the 50-minute class block you have, which means you have around 10-minutes per problem --
which can be quite little to do a proof. This means if you get stuck on an exam, you're pretty much
toast. To best prepare for exams, you should know how to identify what to do for problems very quickly,
meaning you need a plan of attack for every problem. If you can figure out how to do a problem,
then you'll be fine, but if you are stuck, you should certainly have a backup plan to try to earn
some partial credit. If you are stuck on a proof, demonstrating that you understand the course content
will often give significant partial credit. For example, providing a base case on an inductive proof 
will certaintly lead to partial credit even if the problem is not completed. Many professors also 
offer extra credit problems on exams.

## How to do well

- If you notice you're missing a lot of points on your homeworks for poor proof techniques,
  you should definitely consult a TA and ask for advice on how to make your proofs better. 
  Going to office hours for homework and exams is always helpful but they tend to get very
  crowded before exam and homework due dates. 
- Learning LaTeX and writing your homeworks in it can benefit you substantially later on in your
  CMU career. While it certainly has a high learning curve to start off, it will pay dividends.
  It also helps you write better proofs since it's a lot easier to revise your work, and you'll
  eventually learn to format your work to communicate your ideas better. Some professors will
  give extra credit on homework if your answers are formatted in LaTeX.
- Practicing competition math problems can help you with your speed and problem solving skills.
  There are also many resources online from other universities with similar proof-based courses
  that can provide practice problems for the topics covered in class.
